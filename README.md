## Setting up the project locally
I have used Express for the application and Jest and SuperTest for testing the application:

    npm install express
    npm install jest supertest --save-dev2

### process.env.PORT env variable
to override the default port which is 3000 for this app, we could use `process.env.PORT` env variable.
